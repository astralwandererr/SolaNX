**SolaNX**

DePIN for Solar Infrastructure

Our DePIN project leverages blockchain technology and crypto economics to create a decentralized solar park where individuals can participate in the renewable energy sector and contribute to sustainability goals. Using SolNX as its native token on the Solana blockchain, the platform allows users to stake their solar panels and earn rewards based on the energy they generate. Income from electricity production is shared between the stakeholders and solar park owners. As the project grows,it will transition into a DAO, providing full decentralization and governance to the community.
